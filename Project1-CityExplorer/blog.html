            <h2>The Bavarian Army Museum</h2>
            <p>
                The Bavarian Army Museum is one of the largest military history museums in Europe, 
                housed within the magnificent New Castle (Neues Schloss) in Ingolstadt. Founded in 1879, 
                the museum offers a comprehensive journey through Bavarian military history from the 
                Middle Ages to the present day.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes this museum particularly remarkable is its balanced approach to military history. 
                Rather than glorifying war, it presents a critical examination of military conflicts and 
                their impact on society. The museum's collections include impressive displays of armor, 
                weapons, uniforms, and historical artifacts that tell the story of Bavaria's military past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't miss the World War I exhibition in the Reduit Tilly, which provides a sobering 
                look at the realities of modern warfare. The museum's location in the 15th-century 
                Gothic castle adds to the atmospheric experience, making it a must-visit for history 
                enthusiasts and casual visitors alike.

            <h2>Audi's Heritage in Ingolstadt</h2>
            <p>
                Ingolstadt and Audi share a history that dates back to the post-World War II era. 
                While Audi's roots are in Saxony, the company found its new home in Ingolstadt in 1949 
                when the Auto Union GmbH was reestablished here. Today, Ingolstadt is synonymous with 
                Audi's global headquarters and main production facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Audi Museum Mobile, located next to the factory, takes visitors on an exciting 
                journey through automotive history. From the historic Auto Union racing cars to the 
                latest Audi models, the museum showcases the brand's commitment to innovation, 
                design, and engineering excellence. The museum's circular architecture symbolizes 
                the continuous development of automotive technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the museum, Audi's presence has shaped Ingolstadt's modern identity. The 
                company is the city's largest employer and has contributed significantly to its 
                economic growth and international recognition. The Audi Sportpark, home to FC 
                Ingolstadt 04, stands as another testament to the company's deep integration 
                into the city's cultural and social life.
